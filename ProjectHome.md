A very rough example project demonstrating an implementation of OAuth to access the Twitter API using only C++ and the Win32 API, without any external dependencies.

This is not an example of the right way to do things, it's an example of how to do it with as little work as possible.  However feel free to let me know if there are bugs you think should be fixed, or anything that is blatantly wrong.

The blog posts discussing the code here are:
